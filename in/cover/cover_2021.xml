			 I'm a generalist with knowledge up and down the stack, having architected and developed on numerous systems across many business needs.
			 In particular, I cite my work at Intuit; architecting Wordpress platform on AWS, authoring plugins and components, and working with
			 developers/content-creators to increase the organization's velocity.

			 I have a passion for software development with an approach that's similar to yoga.
			 It's a practise that's to be performed everyday.  How can I/we
			 get better day to day?  I enjoy in the working with others, creating that
			 collective mindspace where groups of individuals are executing code in our
			 thoughts.  Encouraging each other to try new things, and recognizing efforts large
			 and small that make for great teams.
