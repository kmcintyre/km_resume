		<title>Summary</title>
		<lead>
			Prior to 2000 my experience was in coding all
			aspects of the web with ASP, Perl, Cold Fusion, and MSSQL.  2000-2010 I 
			primarily focused on open source technologies with an emphasis on Linux, apache, java/ 
			J2EE development.  Since, I've deepened my utilization of OSS, delivering and securing solutions to any need.  
		</lead>
		<lead>
			As a member of a team and part of an organization, I've always tried to be a fun dependable  
			co-worker, believing that successful software is a combination of clear objectives and team 
			cohesion.
		</lead>
		<lead>
			My development philosophy is tool based, as a means of useful software utilized during all phases of the development cycle; 
			that can act in Agile aspects - delivering early and often, but also as a means of research and selection, by establishing 
			thresholds/boundaries that yield into operation metrics/visibility.  Ultimately tools acting as infrastructure that are 
			non-pollutive with regards to ease of maintenance and predictable upgrade cycles.
		</lead>
		<lead>
			Most recently I have pursued software projects within personal interest to further my learning of 
			cloud based development, and reactive based programming.
